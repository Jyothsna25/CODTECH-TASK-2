### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a responsive portfolio website using React.js and Express.js with Node.js to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer. It aims to provide a modern user interface, seamless user experience, and easy networking through contact forms and social media integration. This portfolio will demonstrate my technical proficiency and serve as a professional representation of my work.

### Technologies used:
**Frontend:** React.js for building a modern, responsive user interface with component-based architecture and efficient state management. </br>
**Backend:** Express.js and Node.js for creating a scalable server-side environment.

### Work flow:
**Initialize Frontend:** Use `create-react-app` to set up the React project in the client directory. </br>
**Initialize Backend:** Set up the Express project in the server directory using npm init and install necessary dependencies.
### Development Phase:
**Frontend Development:**
Create React components for different sections (e.g., Home, Projects, About, Contact). </br>
Implement routing using react-router-dom for navigation between pages. </br>
Design and style components using CSS, SASS, or styled-components. </br>
**Backend Development:** <br>
Set up Express server and define routes for API endpoints.
